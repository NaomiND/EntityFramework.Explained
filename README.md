# EntityFramework.Explained
> Because We Need to Talk About Kevin.


EntityFramework.Explained is a living catalogue of Entity Framework Coreâ€™s real-world behaviour.   

Not just the documented features, but also the subtle quirks and edge cases you discover in practice.  

Each entry combines minimal, focused code samples with generated database schema output and/or observed runtime results.  

By showing both what you write and what EF actually does, it helps you understand how conventions, data annotations, and configuration interact across different providers,  and where reality might differ from expectations.
